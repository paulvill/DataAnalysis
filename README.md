# DataAnalysis

You will find on this repository a first tutorial called [Dimensionality reduction](https://github.com/paulvill/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Dimensionality%20reduction.ipynb) - when you're done with the first tutorial, you can choose between a tutorial on [multi-omics data](https://github.com/paulvill/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Integration.ipynb) or on [Dimensionality reduction with optimal transport](https://github.com/paulvill/DataAnalysis/blob/main/optimal_transport.ipynb).
